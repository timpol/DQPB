DQPB: software for calculating disequilibrium U-Pb ages
==================================================================

DQPB is a standalone GUI application for geochronology focused on calculating disequilibrium U-Pb ages and plotting results, however, it can also be used for computing standard equilibrium U-Pb ages, performing linear regression and computing weighted averages. The software allows isotopic data to be read directly from open Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, and results (both graphical and numerical) printed back to the same worksheet once computations are completed. In this way, it aims to emulate the ease of use of Ken Ludwig’s popular Isoplot/Ex program. The program is distributed on Windows and macOS as a stand-alone application that does not require a pre-existing Python installation to run.

DQPB can be used to:

* Calculate disequilibrium U-Pb concordia-intercept ages on a Tera-Wasserburg diagram
* Calculate disequilibrium |238U|-|206Pb| and |235U|-|207Pb| isochron ages
* Calculate disequilibrium |206Pb|/|238U| and |207Pb|/|235U| (single analysis) ages
* Calculate modified |207Pb| ages using an approach similar to [SAKATA2018]_
* Calculate initial equilibrium U-Pb ages using the above approaches.
* Compute “concordant” initial [|234U|/|238U|] values from U-Pb isochron data using the routine described in [ENGEL2019]_
* Perform linear regression using algorithms that are based on classical statistics (i.e., the model 1, 2, and 3 popularised by Isoplot [LUDWIG2012]_, or robust statistics (i.e., the spine algorithm of [POWELL2020]_ and a new “robust model 2” algorithm).
* Compute weighted averages that optionally account for data point uncertainty covariances using both classical and robust algorithms
* Plot data points and disequilibrium concordia curves on a Tera-Wasserburg diagram

The functionality of DQPB is also available as part of a pure Python package for more experienced Python users. For this version, see the `Pysoplot`_ GitHub page.
